# Jordan McGalliard Portfolio

The projects in this portfolio show my progression from knowing almost nothing about Web Development (the bottom of the portfolio) to my current level (the top.) I have been learning Web Development during my freetime while working, travelling, and living my life. <br/><br/>

This doesn't include all the projects I've ever done.

## **6. The Letter Store 9/10/2022**

My first project that I tried to make  responsive to a reasonable degree. I learned so much about React and more advanced CSS techniques during this project. Users select and customize tiles that could be used in home improvement projects.

### Features

- Responsive to a reasonable degree
- A homepage with a "Browse" button leading to the shop
- Links to different parts of the website using React Router and Link components
- The background of the homepage is scrollable, so people can see what the tiles might look like. They spell out "Howdy Partner." (That's what we say in Wyoming)
- A toggle-able top menu when the screen is less than 750px wide. I made it with CSS positioning, transform, & transitions.
- A 'Shop' page where users can look at all the different letters and customize their colors. 
- A fun 'Randomize Color' button on the shop page, which changes the colors of many different elements and most importantly the tiles that users can choose from. The colors stay changed on subsequent page visits.
- The ability to add and remove tiles from the cart

### Technologies Used

- React
- React Router
- JavaScript, CSS, HTML
- Git, GitHub
